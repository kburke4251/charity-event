    <section id="about">
        <p>Bradley Lowery was a boy who had battled neuroblastoma twice in his life. He won the first one, but then got it back and lost it on July 7, 2017. He loved soccer and his favourite team was Sunderland FC and had front row seats to each game, home and away. His family was close to famous English soccer player, Jermain Defoe, who at the time played for Sunderland. Sunderland was very helpful with paying for treatment and donating to the <a href="https://bradleyloweryfoundation.com/">Bradley Lowery Foundation</a> after he died. All english soccer fans have seen or heard of him and will always be remembered as the boy who fought like a lion throughout his battle.</p>
